  <h1>Planetes</h1>
  <p>This one is the odd one out, as Planetes is a slow, more methodical anime compared to the other two. It's also much more grounded in reality than the other two. This hard sci-fi journey follows garbage people. What's so special about them? They're in space! Why are they in space? Because it turns out debris in our orbit can do very bad things, like wreck transportation, and space development. Don't worry, even though they are essentially astronauts, they are treated just as poorly as garbage people in the here and now. If you've ever worked a low-paying underappreciated job/gig, you will aboslutely love this anime. Even though it starts out slow, it'll end on a roller coaster of emotions. I love recommending this anime is because this is more aimed at adults, in a different way than most people who say "Adult Only" mean. The main characters are all fully mature adults with adult problems, which is nice to see amidst a medium so heavily plagued by mediocre high school rom-coms. Unfortunately, this isn't streaming anywhere yet. Luckily, there is a BluRay box being released in the UK, but for the rest of us, you'll have to break out your eyepatch if you want to watch it.</p>
