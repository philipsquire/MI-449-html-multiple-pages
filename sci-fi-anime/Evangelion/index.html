  <h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion</h1>
  <p>This was recently a source of memes, specifically, the version Netflix put on its service. The poor handling of the series has been mostly corrected since it was initally put on the service (although the removal of the original ending themes sets a horrible precedent for what is allowed with popular classic anime), Evangelion is still worth watching because it tackles relationships and the struggle between the characters and the world as a whole better than anything else. It's also essentially the Star Wars of Japan in terms of merchandising, so you might as well give it a shot. Watch the original series, then the End of Evangelion movie afterwards. If you want to see them do something wildly different with the characters, check out the "rebuild" films afterwards (though you may not want to get your expectations too high).</p>
